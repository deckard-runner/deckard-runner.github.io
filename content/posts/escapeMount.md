Escaping Mount:

There's an a/b choice. Start with arm across hip, and other arm tucked in tight to body and supporting the other arm. Feet are as close to myself as possible, then bridge hard and shrimp. Depending on their reaction:

a) if you end up in modified mount, shrimp into the leg that's against my stomach (my instinct of shrimping other way is wrong) and attempt to stretch them out so there's space to get my leg in/under them to create space and knee shield. Once I have a leg in, basically transition into SLX and begin leg entanglement/straight ankle lock etc.

b) If they don't go to s-mount, more shrimps and get a knee shield in. Can go to half guard, or preferably double butterfly and situp. Begin attacking.


Subs from mount:

Instead of going for head and arm choke or americana, can sit up high and back, so opponent is fully carrying my bodyweight on their hips. This makes it hard for them to move. Using a 2-on-1 baseball style grip, isolate and separate an arm from center of their body to the mat.

They will likely roll to that side, so then use my sternum to push behind their elbow to begin a gift wrap, trapping their arm up. Once their arm is secure, get a high mount on them, and can then basically pick them up and take their back. Looking ideally for getting grips on both their arms

In the way a straightjacket works, will have to fight for this. Legs can transition from double hooks to a body lock, or if they're to big, similar position but feet on together instead of locked at knee. Try and force their top arm down and trap with my heel, pulling their arm out of the game and then tucking my leg deep behind their back to secure it and prevent their escaping it. Then it's 2-on-1 for the RNC. If I lose the position, transition back to mount and re-engage the attack cycle. If you can get an arm trapped, a kimura style grip is useful to isolate the remaining arm, pull it up towards me and above their head, again gripping behind the elbow. Can either armbar or secure a triangle from the back and finish or both together.
more notes to remember when trying to hand fight from the back:

- The person with the top hand position is winning. When you are trying to hand fight look to win back the top hand position or attacking for a sub will be very difficult
- Cross wrist grips are the most powerful (like in the picture below) and straight wrist grips are usable but not ideal. Cross grips allow a more dominant angle to trap the arm.
