Transition from side control gone wrong:

Starting in side control, when the opponent has made to much space and begun to re-guard, I want to transition and spin to their back. Place hand on back of their head to pull down, so if I miss the leg step over I don’t nail them in the face. I then step over and put my foot behind the mid point of their back, and put it close so it acts as a wedge. That knee comes down, and I’ll find myself straddling them with opponent on their side. I can then setup for a kimura and attack that if I choose, or once that’s in place, shift my weight onto them and get my elbow across their waist as I spin to their back. Keep weight/elbow on them, so they can’t move easily. Expectation is then they’ll move into a turtle position and it’s back to dismantling turtle.
 
Turtle, get knee in if there’s no space, and make some. I want to track their elbow so they can’t reach back by placing my hand on theirs, and prevent it. Also can push their arm forward to create an off-balance by essentially removing their post. Other arm hugs around their waist and stay low, with them carrying my weight to slow them down. My foot closest to theirs goes in between and does a coyote style pull to make space and off-balance, as I pull them into me get bottom leg in and pull into back attack sequence.
