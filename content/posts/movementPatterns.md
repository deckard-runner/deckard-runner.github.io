Covered 3 areas; more details and reps for back finish, and two movement patterns that are likely to occur from escaping side control.

Back details:

Biggest one that seems of no consequence but is super important is when going for the armbar from the back, make sure to get my lower leg weaved above opponents arms (i.e. almost under their chin) so that when their grip breaks and they try and posture/hitchhiker/etc I’m already in place and not scrambling to try and get my position set. Second thing is to spend more time thinking/focusing on the arm entrapment before I go for the body triangle or armbar. Really make sure I’ve got proper kimura like grips on the arm I want to control and lock their arm tight and away from their body, so it’s nicely isolated. It’s much easier to pull them to switch my arms and finish the attack sequence. I think I was forgetting a bit to keep this tight against me during the transition and the opponent was taking advantage of the space to escape. The other benefit of having properly set the lower leg earlier too is that if I lose the armbar, they’ve turned into me and are basically already in a triangle. Finish by applying the dilemma of armbar or triangle, likely both simultaneously. 


Movement pattern 1: 

Assume first escape from side control works, and I’m on my side with my arms all tight in and facing the opponent. I basically turtle down and attempt to grab their closest knee and ankle. I then apply pressure to their ankle pulling it into me, while their knee is fixed, very similar to the dogfight position from half-guard. This pressure keeps the opponent from being able to turn to face me, and helps prevent guillotines etc. Also similar to dogfight, attempt to crush forward and flatten the opponent. Best case is you can get behind them and take the back. 

If they get in front of me and are going for a front head lock, loop choke, or guillotine etc. sort of attack. They have height on me, and are potentially sprawling as well. This time sit-out through, and really exaggerate the movement (no small moves). Once through, spin around and get behind the opponent, blocking both their near side elbow (so they can’t turn back to face you) and sitting on their nearest support leg (while I pin it by sitting on top of their achilles). Make sure my knee is between their legs. At this point I should be in a great position to take their back and resume an offence cycle. 

Movement pattern 2:

This one follows the 3rd escape from side control pattern; legs pendulum out to make space, and I’m pushing on their tricep to try and get out while pushing them lower onto me. This time as I try to scramble out they’re coming up on me but I still have some mobility. Granby roll: Shoulder goes down and roll into the side where your opponent is. First leg over I want really high and big, so that I’m almost sweeping the air clear of the opponent. Practise against a wall to get the feel for the movement, want to catch the opponent between legs and then put them into an open guard.
