Lockdown:
Annoying, definitely dangerous for my knee. Other than just hanging out and waiting, I can try and unhook my foot and tuck it in and out of the way. If that doesn't work, I can slowly go back down towards their feet bringing my heel to my ass and basically try and ankle lock them back with their own lockdown. Overall, no shame in just sitting and waiting due to danger. 

RNC Finish:
Get to the position I normally want, with my elbow in front. Once there, breathe in and use back muscles to reduce space. Then add a twist in the direction on the arm that's choking, and think of doing almost a row motion where I pull back further. The combination of chest and back means I don't need to use more arm strength, and will reduce space making the choke much tighter. 

Alt seq to session 2/5 leg drag:
If I can't get my hand inside the knee shield and on the inside of their leg, just push their knee shield down and collapse their legs. Then step over both and use my shin to staple their legs down (I was having a problem with this in open mat after, I think I was stapling too low and they were able to re-raise up the knee shield at least partially. Once stapled, can push their bottom arm back under them further and go for the dagastani handcuff. Note to self, it's not enough to just get into the elbow, want wrist control. Then move up and try to underhook the closest arm. This will place a strong twist on them and keep them misaligned even though our spines are both in the same direction. Windshield wiper the leg staple and then can finish passing to the back etc.
