Emily Kwok seminar Aug 24 was interesting. She covered SLX and X-guard, how they interrelate and transitions between the two. 

X-guard: 3 main things you can do from this position; elevation (what people commmonly expect) which is lifting them up, extension which is pushing them away, and third, which she started with, is off-balancing them. The off-balanacing is the most subtle, with two important points. First, I found for it to work, their leg closest to my head (their ankle) really needs to be almost skin to skin with the side of my neck. If it's not jammed in close, you think the move should work but it doesn't really. Way to much force required. The other subtlety is the off-balancing. You need to be calm and soft, while still retaining your sticky hooks. Then, quick movement with both legs exploding for a moment to generate the startle response in the opponent, which will off-balance them. Always being hard makes them expect your movement, and you won't get the response you want. 

Entry into SLX starts with shin to shin and wrap arm around back of their knee. Fall to my side (not back) and spin underneath, almost like I'm going for deep half guard. Lots of transitions to leg locks from here. Another small difference is the finish of the straigh ankle lock, twist my body to the outside rather than just pull back, and the force is way stronger. You'll get the tap faster. Other concept as a general rule, she stated 'move legs before the grips, and only move from a position if the new one gives you an advantage.' 

Polarity mapping is a concept from executive coaching. Basically need to have both a hard/soft with most moves in bjj, and this concept helps you mentally balance them when one side seems to take over. [Polarity Map Overview](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sloww.co%2Fpolarity-thinking-101%2F&psig=AOvVaw0CSJwySsnFZjDqCJfyUh5X&ust=1724952304298000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBQQjRxqFwoTCLjr-56amIgDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAZ) By filling in the positives and negatives with each side, it helps you mentally identify when one is over powering the other and how to think about it differently to try and balance them out better.
