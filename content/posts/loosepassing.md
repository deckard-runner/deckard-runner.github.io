Loose passing: back of head ‘mini’ snapdown to cause them to pull back, and use that reaction to ankle pick and make putting them on their back easier.
(Note to self: tried in open mat after lesson, was not able to elicit the response as expected. ) Once they’re seated/on their back, vgrips the shins just below the knee. Quick fake and go to the other side, placing my shin/knee on their hip to prevent them turning into me. Tripod head onto their shoulder, cup their knee on leg closest to the ground and other hand goes to frame on their hip and keep their knee shield outside my arm. Using a circle type motion, spin opponents leg down to the other side and rotate their legs/hips to face opposite side. Then we do the modified leg drag type move where I step super deep and use my leg to take away movement and therefore power from the opponent, like what we’d do for headquarters. My upper body has to be off at a 45 degree angle and not spine aligned. This basically compresses and twists my opponent and feels very heavy with no movement options for them.
