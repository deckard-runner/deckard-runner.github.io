2 main sections, side control escape and further tweaks to back attack triangle/armbar combo.

For the back, big difference is getting higher up before I transition from giftwrap to back. Think around the height of their head to put my knee, instead of behind their shoulder blade. Once on the back, can fight for the RNC. If I feel like I need to get higher once I'm already on the back, can push down on their shoulder to try and get higher up their back. Another big diff was getting a grip on their arm similar to a kimura, and really pulling it up so they lose the ability to really use it. These two changes made a big difference today rolling against resisting opps, but I wasn't able to finish the next steps yet. I'm still not getting the triangle cinched, and again transitioned to armbars. I tried each time to get the shin on the back of their head, wasn't able to get it into position before I lost the body position. Then it devolved to a regular fight against an armbar. Gonna have to work on this some more. Maybe I'm not spending enough time going for the RNC earlier...

Side control; 3 main ways to escape depending on the opp. First is trying to align spines by pushing their face back to parallel with me (sort of club them in the face and push). I found this wasn't successful against Misha or Brock when they had me in side control today. Goal if it worked idea is to get inside elbow into connection with my knee, and then if they're still pressuring I can follow them by sticky leg/arm as they try to re-pass. When they stop that, get half butterfly in (although this will look more like an x-guard at this point) and try to get leg into a half guard style position again so I have leverage to push and pressure more into the sweep. Must go for the sweep and threaten even if fails, so I can off balance, make them respect my position, and then regard. If they go for bodylock, must immediately drop my back onto the mat again to stop the lock.

Second side control escape is to do a pendulum swing with the legs to make space, get knee back in, or more likely get a v-grip on their elbow and push their arm down my body. Then shrimp out and scramble out. May take multiple swings.

Third variant is when #1 fails, as it did today; get on my side, big circle arm around and bring my elbow in tight. Try and get into a dogfight position, and I can pull their foot towards me to put pressure on their knee. 

good news is I was able to get out of both M and B's side control, although I hadn't internalized the choices yet and I felt slow as I was thinking through the steps before initiating. 

knee on belly: must immediately do option #3 to escape, can't rest in that position. They'll move to mount or just tire me out to much being static. Must move.
