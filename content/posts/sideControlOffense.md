Beginning in side mount, the idea is how to integrate this position into the previous half guard/mount attack sequencing.
 

Initially looking to pin the nearside arm of the opponent under my shin. They could have their arm in basically in 3 different positions, but the goal is the same.


If they’re going for the underhook strongly, and I can’t pin the arm, use knee and go for the bicep; it’ll suck for them and you’ll quickly get the arm. In other positions, can either just pin directly with shin or use nearest hand to feed arm under my shin. At this point I should have their arm pinned and a strong crossface in place, reaching behind their head and grabbing their lat/armpit for anchoring. If really can’t get the arm pinned, transitioning to a knee-on-belly and then back should give me what I’m looking for. Depending on their reaction I can either go straight to the previous mount attacks or get the arm pin and continue this sequence.
 

Once pinned, can switch which leg is doing the pin, ideally I want my right leg pinning so I can transition to a kimura attack on their far arm. Once the leg is correct, can scoop their fair shoulder and pull them toward me, step over their back and use my leg as a wedge to prevent them going flat, then establish kimura grips. If they’re resisting, lean back so I can use my legs and back to break their grip on their clothing or other hand. Then place their hand behind their back. Get heavy and get onto just my toes and really stretch out and almost flatten them. Slowly finish kimura.
 

Idea during all this is the attacks are slow and methodical, never giving up position as I progress and going for high percentage finishes. 

End goal is either kimura, gift wrap to back control or gift wrap to armbar.
