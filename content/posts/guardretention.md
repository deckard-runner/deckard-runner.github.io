Guard retention:
3 stages, early middle late. 

Framing; cross shoulder (arms) and cross waist (legs) with a C type body position to make rotation easy. I basically sticky myself to my opponent and then no matter how fast/slow they move, I come along for the ride. If I lose the position and their passing is advancing, the mini-granby rolls get used to make space and change the angle for me, basically getting me off the original line my opponent was trying to pass (ie. got past my knee line). Need to be on my side and not allow them to put me flat on my back. Need to keep space between by hips and my opponent, and I can keep spamming the mini-granby to get that space. 

Throat 'punch' to make space to re-pummel leg (easier in gi, but can just grab throat to improvise similar effect no-gi). Not trying to hurt them, just move them to the side to change the angle and make space for my foot to get onto their shoulder. 

Other concept: not letting opponent control my head/spine, and can prevent this either by "combing my hair" or using bicep frames to maintain some space and control.

Kesa: when getting crushed, can push them forward toward my head to get their pressure off my floating ribs. My ribcage will suffice until it breaks or I can improve my position. Escape from kesa by wrapping my arms like heimlich maneuver, just under their fat/ribs and join my hands. Then 2 parts, first is turn my face and pull my hands over my head, then roll them off. They should feel quite light when I do this. 

Passing knee shield:
Flatten hips straight to floor, and pull myself with my toe to the side. 

Knee cut gets stuck, knee re-orients backwards, and I begin shuffling forward till I pass the knee shield, then without changing my hip position, shuffle my ass back till I turn them away. Then can change my hips and take side control. 

Getting stuck in half guard: 
Similar to flatten hips, entangled leg goes straight and I move down a bit and parrallel to opponent. Free my leg, keeping hips low as possible to prevent then getting knee back in. Then move to pass.
