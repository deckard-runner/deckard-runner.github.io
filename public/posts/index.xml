      <description>Covered 3 areas; more details and reps for back finish, and two movement patterns that are likely to occur from escaping side control.&#xA;Back details:&#xA;Biggest one that seems of no consequence but is super important is when going for the armbar from the back, make sure to get my lower leg weaved above opponents arms (i.e. almost under their chin) so that when their grip breaks and they try and posture/hitchhiker/etc Iâ€™m already in place and not scrambling to try and get my position set.</description>
