      <description>Beginning in side mount, the idea is how to integrate this position into the previous half guard/mount attack sequencing. Initially looking to pin the nearside arm of the opponent under my shin. They could have their arm in basically in 3 different positions, but the goal is the same.&#xA;If they’re going for the underhook strongly, and I can’t pin the arm, use knee and go for the bicep; it’ll suck for them and you’ll quickly get the arm.</description>

      <title>Escaping Mount; subs from mount</title>

      <description>Escaping Mount:&#xA;There&amp;rsquo;s an a/b choice. Start with arm across hip, and other arm tucked in tight to body and supporting the other arm. Feet are as close to myself as possible, then bridge hard and shrimp. Depending on their reaction:&#xA;a) if you end up in modified mount, shrimp into the leg that&amp;rsquo;s against my stomach (my instinct of shrimping other way is wrong) and attempt to stretch them out so there&amp;rsquo;s space to get my leg in/under them to create space and knee shield.</description>

      <title>Side Control, and tweaks to back attack/triangle armbar combo</title>

      <description>2 main sections, side control escape and further tweaks to back attack triangle/armbar combo.&#xA;For the back, big difference is getting higher up before I transition from giftwrap to back. Think around the height of their head to put my knee, instead of behind their shoulder blade. Once on the back, can fight for the RNC. If I feel like I need to get higher once I&amp;rsquo;m already on the back, can push down on their shoulder to try and get higher up their back.</description>

      <title>Additional Back Details, Two Movement Patterns</title>

      <description>Covered 3 areas; more details and reps for back finish, and two movement patterns that are likely to occur from escaping side control.&#xA;Back details:&#xA;Biggest one that seems of no consequence but is super important is when going for the armbar from the back, make sure to get my lower leg weaved above opponents arms (i.e. almost under their chin) so that when their grip breaks and they try and posture/hitchhiker/etc I’m already in place and not scrambling to try and get my position set.</description>
